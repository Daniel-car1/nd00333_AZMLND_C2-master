# Operationalizing Machine Learning

*TODO:* Write an overview to your project.\
This project was all about investigating the [Bank Marketing dataset](https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv) with cloud-based Machine Learning methods using the Microsoft Azure ML studio and the Python SDK with the focus on deploying an Auto ML model, consuming the REST endpoint and using pipeline automation to launch the model automated into production.


## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step.\

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screencasts required to demonstrate key steps.\ 

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.\

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:\

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.\
